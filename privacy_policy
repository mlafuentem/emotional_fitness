7. Data Security

At 'Emotional Fitness', we prioritize the security of your personal data. We have implemented a range of technical and organizational measures to ensure that your data is protected from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.

7.1 Supabase Database

All user data is stored on a Supabase database, a modern platform that adheres to industry-standard security measures. Supabase is designed with security in mind, ensuring that your data is stored safely.

7.2 Row Level Security

We have applied Row Level Security (RLS) to all our database tables. This means that access to data is restricted at the row level based on specific criteria. By implementing RLS, we ensure that only authorized users can access specific sets of data, enhancing the overall security of the data stored.

7.3 Table Policies

Every table in our database has specific policies for select, insert, and update operations. These policies are designed to prevent unauthorized or malicious actions, ensuring that data can only be accessed or modified in accordance with our strict guidelines.

7.4 Encryption of Critical Data

Certain types of data, which we consider critical, are encrypted in our backend. This includes sensitive information such as passwords. By encrypting this data, we add an additional layer of protection, ensuring that even in the unlikely event of a breach, that data remains unreadable.

7.5 Authentication Process

Our authentication process is managed by auth schemas that are fully overseen by Supabase. These schemas are out of the user's range and adhere to the highest security standards in the industry. This ensures that user accounts are protected from unauthorized access.

7.6 Data Encryption within the App

All types of data stored within the 'Emotional Fitness' app are encrypted by Flutterflow. This means that data, both at rest and in transit, is protected from potential interception or unauthorized access.

7.7 Continuous Monitoring and Updates

We continuously monitor our systems and update our security practices in response to the evolving threat landscape. Our commitment is to ensure that 'Emotional Fitness' remains a secure platform for all our users.

We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 18 or knowingly allow such persons to register for an account with 'Emotional Fitness'.

8.2 No Collection of Child Data

As our service is not intended for children under 18, we do not have features that are designed to collect information from children. If we discover that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a person under the age of 18, we will promptly take steps to delete that information.

8.3 Parental Notice

If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under the age of 18 has created an account with 'Emotional Fitness' without your consent, please notify us immediately, see contact information at the bottom of this document, and we will take appropriate action to remove the child’s information from our systems.
